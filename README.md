# Amazon Review Helpfulness Analysis

This project analyzes what makes an Amazon product review genuinely helpful to other shoppers. I designed and built this project to explore how writing style, emotional tone, authenticity, and behavioral signals influence review helpfulness using real-world e-commerce data.

The goal was to create something practical and realistic that shows how data analytics, NLP, and psycholinguistics can support better decision-making on e-commerce platforms.

# 📊 Project Demo

I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize how different review characteristics impact helpfulness across ratings, tone, and linguistic features:

# What this project does

The project analyzes Amazon consumer electronics reviews (2019–2025) to identify which linguistic and behavioral factors drive helpfulness votes. It examines review length, sentiment, sarcasm, humor, emotional tone, verification status, and rating score.

Instead of treating all reviews the same, this analysis highlights which reviews truly add value and why — helping platforms surface more credible and useful content.

# Why I built this

I built this project to apply data analytics and NLP techniques to a real-world business problem in e-commerce. My focus was on understanding why certain reviews stand out rather than just predicting outcomes.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- Working with real, messy review data
- Applying psycholinguistic theory to business analytics
- Building explainable machine learning models
- Translating statistical results into practical insights

# 🖼️ Screenshots

Below are some screenshots from the Tableau dashboard and analysis to give a better idea of the insights and visualizations.

# Key highlights

- Analyzed Amazon consumer electronics reviews (2019–2025) using psycholinguistic features
- Identified review length as the strongest predictor of helpfulness
- Built regression-based machine learning models to explain review usefulness
- Found that verified purchases, higher ratings, and sarcastic tone increase credibility
- Converted analytical results into actionable recommendations for e-commerce platforms

# Tech used
- Python
- LIWC-22 (Psycholinguistic Analysis)
- Hugging Face Transformers (sarcasm & humor detection)
- SPSS (regression modeling)
- Tableau & Tableau Prep
- Google Colab
- Excel

# What’s next

This project can be extended by adding more advanced models, expanding to other product categories, or integrating automated review scoring and real-time dashboards. It serves as a strong foundation for deeper work in product analytics, NLP, and consumer behavior analysis.
